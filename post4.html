            <p>
                According to “Designing for the Web vs. Apps in the Mobile Era”, Mobile design is for tasks while
                Desktop design is for information. Mobile design focuses on interactive design while websites focus on
                information architecture.

            </p>

            <p>Mobile is constrained; it has structure and its contents are prioritized. Secondary information may have
                to be reduced or placed on a second page; images and texts may have to be cut or reduced. One has to
                understand what a user wants to accomplish and create a mobile design that flows well. Interactive
                design is a key element.

            </p>
            <p>Websites are for information. Content should be straightforward and easily readable. Common words should
                be used and complicated sentences should not be used. A strong visual hierarchy should be created so
                that users will know where and what the key information is. We need to take into consideration line
                height, and font size. Information architecture encompasses the idea of a desktop design.


            </p>
            <p>I found this article interesting because I’ve never thought about the design for mobile or desktop. I
                found some points that were made to be true. When I search up something on my phone, it is usually
                something that I want an answer for, produced quickly. For example, I reach for my phone when I want to
                look up what movies are playing in a nearby theater, or look up something about an actor/actress, or an
                address. And when I want to look up song lyrics, I will most likely look it up on my phone. When I use
                my phone to search for something, my goal isn't to read for a long time; it is to quickly get
                information.


            </p>
            <p>I reach for my computer when I am doing school work. When I have to do research, I use my laptop because
                it is easier to read and understand all the content on a bigger screen. Another advantage is that I can
                have multiple tabs open, which I can also do on my phone, but on my laptop, I can easily navigate from
                one site to the next to get the information I need. I also tend to use my laptop when I am looking at
                pictures. On my phone, I sometimes don’t get the full picture or see all the details that I normally
                would on my laptop.
            </p>
            <p>
                I do prefer using one over another in different situations, like those mentioned above. In some cases,
                either would work for me, but I tend to reach for my phone or laptop for different reasons. There are
                times when I don’t have my laptop nearby, so I use my phone, but when I am near my laptop again, I open
                what I looked up on my phone, onto my laptop.
